            <p>My name is Daniel Bueno. I currently work at an awesome AV Company called Alford Media. I have a B.M. in Percussion Performance from FSU. And, I love playing Dominican Guira.   
            </p>

                My exposure to Dominican music begins with the fact that my father is from DR. We would have get-togethers with my father’s side of the family and he’d have the same CDs playing repetitively. I became familiar with artists like Juan Luis Guerra, Sergio Vargas, and Kinito Mendez and my favorite parts became the complicated rhythmic breaks. As I developed a love for percussion, my interest in Merengue continued to flourish. YouTube, listening, transcribing, and messaging professional guireros on social media became the primary sources for learning. And, finally in 2016 and 2017, I was able to travel to DR to visit family and learn from my idol Neno Guira.

                This tutorial is simply an accumulation of all that I've learned over the years. It contains a guide for the general patterns played,
                methods for practicing, and transcriptions. Thanks for visiting and I hope this moves you forward in your journey to familiarizing yourself with this instrument.
